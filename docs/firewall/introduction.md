RethinkDNS comes with a companion [**Firewall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)) app for Android, that lets you monitor and control Internet access to apps installed on your device. It includes rules such as, _block apps by category_, _block when app is in the background_, _block an app when device is locked_, or _block an app forever_.

RethinkDNS Firewall when configured [DNS](dns), you can analyse DNS requests in real-time and read through aggregated reports in the App logs. And it also helps evade Internet censorship as enforced in most countries.
